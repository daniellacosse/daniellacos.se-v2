### version 2

i'm sick of these frameworks. let's cut out the "muddle man"

### TODO:
* browser support
  * if IE, alternate message, link to chrome
  * noscript, display alternate message
  * also fallback for linear gradient

  * run in safari/firefox/opera for any needed prefixes

* permalink route
* sharing

* attach more sources/documents/infinite scrolling
  * XHRHttpRequest to server
  * hardest part of this whole thing is ensuring feed is consistent and ordered from all sources
* filter toggles

* productionizing
  * aws deploy script

* known bugs (check TODOs)
  * hiding tooltips properly
  * the fucking icon font travesty
  * don't squish the articles so much
  * babel & compressor not working
  * improve deploy script further

* resize, scroll, keypress window event listeners
  * save scroll depth
  * "infinite scrolling"
  * responsiveness (but I don't think we need to do too much)
  * navigate with arrow keys

* preprocess image & iframe body tags.
 * load on scroll (img & iframe)

* debugging/error handling
* reload server on file change (webpack-dev-server?)

* tests?
