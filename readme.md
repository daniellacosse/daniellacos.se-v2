### version 2

i'm sick of these frameworks. let's cut out the "muddle man"

### TODO:
* frontend css
  * favicon & other assets (if any) (icons-loader)
    * data URL everything
* productionizing
  * environments
  * aws & docker
  * tests

* permalink
  * create meta tags

* resize, scroll, keypress window event listeners
* preprocess image & iframe body tags.
 * load on scroll (img & iframe)

* debugging/error handling
* reload server on file change (webpack-dev-server?)

* attach more sources/documents/infinite scrolling
  * XHRHttpRequest to server
  * hardest part of this whole thing is ensuring feed is consistent and ordered from all sources

  NOTES: list of sources
